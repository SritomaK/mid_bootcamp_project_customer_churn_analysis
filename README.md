# Telecom Customer Churn - EDA & Modelling
Customer churn refers to a customer ceasing to use a particular product and transitioning to a competitor's offering. To mitigate customer churn, leveraging data analysis can be instrumental in identifying key features and devising strategies to retain customers and discourage them from switching. Additionally, it is observed that retaining an already loyal customer is generally more feasible than acquiring a new one, underscoring the importance of customer loyalty in the effort to reduce churn.

This project aims to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis on the Telco Customer Churn Dataset. This analysis will reveal valuable insights into customer patterns and why they decide to leave. By understanding these factors, the company can formulate focused strategies to enhance service quality and improve customer retention.

## Information about the Dataset
The dataset on telecom churn comprises details about customers belonging to a telecommunications company and indicates whether they have discontinued their services. It encompasses diverse features encompassing customer demographics (such as age and gender) as well as usage data related to services (like call frequency, minutes used, billing method, etc.).## About the Dataset
The data for this project was obtained from Kaggle's Telecom customer churn dataset. This dataset contains information on over 7,000 telecommunications customers, including their demographics, usage patterns, and whether or not they churned.

## Tools

## Workflow
  ### Data Exploration Plan:

1. Data Overview:

  * Load the dataset into your preferred analysis environment.
  * Review the structure of the dataset, examining features and data types.
  * Identify key columns related to customer demographics and churn status.
    
2. Descriptive Analysis:

Calculate and review summary statistics for numeric columns (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).
Visualize the distribution of churn status and identify any discernible trends.
Explore numeric variables that may impact churn.
Categorical Analysis:

Explore categorical variables such as gender, billing method, etc.
Analyze the distribution of these variables and their impact on churn rates.
Utilize visualizations (e.g., bar charts) to enhance understanding.
Churn Reasons:

Investigate reasons for customer churn. This may involve specific features like call duration, billing issues, etc.
Understand the main drivers behind customer attrition by exploring relevant features.
Consider creating visualizations or charts to illustrate key findings.
Correlation Analysis:

Perform correlation analysis to understand relationships between different variables.
Identify features that correlate strongly with churn status.
Use correlation matrices and visualizations (e.g., heatmaps) for a comprehensive overview.## Insights
