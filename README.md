# Telecom Customer Churn - EDA & Modelling

Customer churn refers to a customer ceasing to use a particular product and transitioning to a competitor's offering. To mitigate customer churn, leveraging data analysis can be instrumental in identifying key features and devising strategies to retain customers and discourage them from switching. Additionally, it is observed that retaining an already loyal customer is generally more feasible than acquiring a new one, underscoring the importance of customer loyalty in the effort to reduce churn.

This project aims to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis on the Telco Customer Churn Dataset. This analysis will reveal valuable insights into customer patterns and why they decide to leave. By understanding these factors, the company can formulate focused strategies to enhance service quality and improve customer retention.
